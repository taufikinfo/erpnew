# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Repository settings:
   - **Repository name**: `erp-system` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "Modern ERP System built with FastAPI, React, and MySQL"
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with setup instructions. Use the "push an existing repository from the command line" section:

```bash
# Add GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Alternative Using GitHub CLI (Optional)

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can create and push in one command:

```bash
# Create repository and push (replace 'erp-system' with your preferred name)
gh repo create erp-system --public --description "Modern ERP System built with FastAPI, React, and MySQL" --push
```

## Step 4: Verify Upload

After pushing, visit your GitHub repository URL to verify all files were uploaded correctly.

## Repository Structure on GitHub

Your repository will contain:
- Complete ERP system code
- Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Backend (FastAPI + Python)
- Database models and seeding scripts
- Documentation and setup guides
- MIT License
- Comprehensive .gitignore

## Next Steps

1. Add repository topics/tags on GitHub: `erp`, `fastapi`, `react`, `mysql`, `typescript`, `python`
2. Create issues for any bugs or feature requests
3. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)
4. Add collaborators if working in a team

## Important Notes

- The repository is ready for production deployment
- All sensitive data is properly ignored (.env files, etc.)
- Database includes seeding scripts for quick setup
- Both frontend and backend have proper startup scripts
